# Stroke-Rehabilitation-Glove
I will be designing a light-weight, cheap and comfortable fabric glove to aid in rehabilitation of mild stroke victims. This glove will be utilizing an Arduino Uno board, five servo motors, 3d-printed rings and finger caps, nylon string and of course a fabric/cloth glove. Since I will be using an Arduino Uno board, I will being using their variation of the C++ language and will have access to their extensive libraries. Finally I will be programming a set few algorithms so the motors will stretch out the users fingers and thumb in predefined patterns as a rehabilitation technique.
